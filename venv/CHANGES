- Improved algorithm SYNC-SOM: accuracy of clustering and calculation are improved in line with proof of concept where connection between oscillator in the second layer (that is represented by the self-organized feature map) should be created in line with classical radius like in SyncNet, but indirectly: if objects that correspond to two different neurons can be connected than neurons should be also connected with each other (pyclustering.cluster.syncsom).
